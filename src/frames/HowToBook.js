                For <span className="underline">new clients</span> an <b>e-transfer deposit of 35%</b> of the rate you’ll
                be seeing me for
                will be required to book for that time you’re requesting for in case you cancel. The deposit is to be sent prior to the meeting to secure ur spot.<br /><br />
                As I’m a high scale, low volume provider this is <b className="underline">non-negotiable</b> with the time, effort, I’ll be putting in to look as
                breath taking as possible to prepare this experience for you that
                no other girl can.<br /><br />
                For existing clients I’ve seen this won’t be needed.<br /><br />
                To continue with the booking procedure, follow through with
                one of my contact methods.<br /><br />
